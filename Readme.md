# LangChain Learning Repository

Welcome to my LangChain Learning Repository! ðŸš€

This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey in learning and experimenting with [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/), a framework that enables seamless interaction between Large Language Models (LLMs) and various resources. Here, youâ€™ll find a collection of files and examples covering different use cases, agents, and chains developed using LangChain.


## About the Project

LangChain is a tool that enhances LLM capabilities by allowing them to interact with data sources, APIs, and complex workflows. Iâ€™ll be adding various scripts, and examples as I explore different LangChain functionalities, from simple chain setups to advanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and custom agents.



## Usage Examples

Here is an example of what you'll find in this repository:
1. **Restaurant Menu Generator**:
   - Creates a unique restaurant headline and suggests a personalized menu based on user input for cuisine and dietary preferences.

2. **Chat with Search**:
   - A simple chatbot that can search for information on the web and various tools such as Arxiv, Wikipedia and DuckDuckGo. Users can ask questions and the bot will provide responses by leveraging these search tools.

3. **Chat with SQL Database**:
   - A chatbot that can interact with a SQL database to retrieve information based on user queries. The bot can search for specific data, filter results, and provide relevant information from the database.


## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aqib0770/LangChain.git
   cd LangChain
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
